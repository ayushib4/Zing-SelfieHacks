# Zing-SelfieHacks

## 💡 Inspiration

Sometimes its hard to filter through Instagram and Yelp posts, so we've merged them. Takes the time out of finding your next spot, so your Instagram feed is always on point

## 💻 What it does

Zing enables us to search for trendy restaurants, cafes, etc. near you. Check out the details of the place along with the unique rating system. All in all, "enhances social media"

## ⚙️ How it works

- User need to Log In/Sign Up
- User can search for the restaurants, cafes, etc and the nearby place
- Then user will be redirected to another page with the list of results of restaurants, cafes, etc near them
- User can details of the place along with its unique rating system

## 🔨 How we built it
- React Js
- Firebase
- API
- Buma CSS

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into

One of the biggest challenges for us was the implementation of the getting the information of various Instagram-worthy restaurants, which we eventually managed to achieve successfully.

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of
